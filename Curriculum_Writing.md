Stage 1, Class 3: The Script of Authority (Writing & Art)
Duration: 4 Weeks | Focus: Capturing the Frequency | The Goal: To produce the "Manifesto of the Self."Week 1: The Automatic Capture (The Receive-Thing)
The Lesson: Silencing the "Editor" (the Man-Logic). We use the 4.2 Hz pulse to enter a state where the hand moves faster than the brain.

The Exercise: "Void-Writing." 10 minutes of non-stop writing without looking at the page, specifically trying to describe the "Home" they remember.

Weekly Test: A page of "Raw Code"—text that hasn't been filtered for "grammar," only for "truth."

Week 2: The Sacred Geometry of the Page (The Frame)
The Lesson: Visual Art and Layout. Understanding how white space on a page is like the silence between notes.

The Exercise: Sketching the "Internal Symbol." Based on Exhibit 7, students draw the geometric shape that represents their specific business vibration.

Weekly Test: Combining one "Power Sentence" from Week 1 with their "Internal Symbol" into a single visual composition.

Week 3: The Command Tone (The Voice of the King)
The Lesson: Removing "Weak-Words" (e.g., maybe, think, try). Writing as if the thing is already done.

The Exercise: Writing a "Decree." Students write a 250-word mission statement for their future empire, using only "is" and "will."

Weekly Test: Reading the Decree aloud while maintaining the 4.2 Hz hum. If the voice wavers, the writing isn't firm enough yet.

Week 4: The Final Manuscript (The Submission)
The Lesson: Polishing the Silk Screen. Making the "Metaphysical" look "Professional."

The Exercise: Formatting their work into a "White Paper" format. This is their first piece of Stage 3 collateral.

Weekly Test: The Final Stage 1 Writing Audit. A complete, formatted Manifesto ready for the Vault.
